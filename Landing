I would suggest to start with the Azure Fundamentals Learning Path on Microsoft Learn: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/paths/azure-fundamentals/ 

The Azure Fundamentals learning path covers the following topics:
-	Understand cloud concepts (15-20%)
-	Understand core Azure services (30-35%)
-	Understand security, privacy, compliance, and trust (25-30%)
-	Understand Azure pricing and support (25-30%)

And for the AZ-900 Exam Scheduling â€“ Please go to: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/learning/exam-AZ-900.aspx 

Please note that some tricky Exam questions come on the below areas, so I would suggest to carefully review the topics:

-	Differences between Azure Support Plans.
-	Differences between: Azure Advisor, Azure Cost Management, Azure BluePrints and Azure Policies.
-	Azure CLI and Azure Power-shell compatibility with Web browsers and Operating Systems.
-	The objectives of the Azure Tagging feature.
-	Differences between the capabilities of each Azure Active Directory offering.
